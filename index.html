            <p class="fade-in">A quiet sadness that settled over the world, soft as ash.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">We called it the Gray Veil.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">It stole the laughter first, then the color from the cheeks of the women we loved.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">It took my sister, Lila's aunt, leaving behind a silence that echoed louder than any scream.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">And the world grew dim.</p>
