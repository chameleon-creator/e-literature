            <p class="fade-in">While the world grew quiet, she dug her hands into the earth.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">She tended a small garden, a patch of stubborn hope. She whispered to the seeds, begging them for color.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">But the flowers that bloomed were pale, their petals the color of ash, as if they too were holding their breath.</p>
